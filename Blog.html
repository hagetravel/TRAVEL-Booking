                  <h2>Our Blog & and Online Booking Registration</h2>
                  <p>
                   <h2>How Do Award Booking Services Work?</h2>
                    While different companies use slightly different business models, typically the process starts with  <br>
                     a booker information about a trip—a desired destination and some dates that will work—and telling them what <br>
                     kinds of miles and/or points are ready to be used. <br>
                    Some services can help narrow down the options for those who just want to get away and might not yet know <br>
                    where; others will only help search for deals that’ll take customers to specific destinations.<br>
                    
                    Generally, customers of award bookers should expect to pay a fixed fee based on the complexity <br>
                    of an itinerary: a multi-stop or around-the-world itinerary in first or business class is likely <br>
                    to cost more than a roundtrip ticket in economy class. Many services will charge a nonrefundable <br>
                    fee for initial searching since that’s often the most time-consuming part of the process: Some will <br>
                    deduct that fee from the total cost if you ultimately book an itinerary they found, while others simply <br>
                    have separate pricing structures for searching and booking.<br>
                    
                    After receiving a request, a service will generally reply relatively quickly with some initial options <br>
                     based on the request and provide options for how to proceed. Once a customer selects an itinerary, <br>
                     they’ll either walk the customer through the booking process or log directly into the customer’s <br>
                     account and book the ticket.<br>
                   <h2>Who Should Use an Award Booking Service?</h2> <br>
                    Like a travel agent or a financial advisor, an award booking service allows customers to pay for someone <br>
                    else’s expertise instead of spending a lot of time doing research about the intricacies of airline <br>
                    partnerships and trying to understand ever-more-complicated pricing structures for redemptions. <br>
                    This can help avoid expensive mistakes on the part of the consumer. It also saves travelers from having <br>
                     to run multiple searches to find which airlines have availability for desired travel dates. <br>
                    
                    Often the best deals are found by booking tickets through the relatively obscure mileage programs <br>
                    of foreign airlines, which can be challenging to navigate and often involve multiple phone calls to <br>
                    agents in another country. <br>
                    
                    It definitely doesn’t make sense to use an award booking service every time someone books a ticket.<br>
                     In most cases, booking a fairly straightforward trip through an award booking service—like a domestic <br>
                     flight or an international trip in coach—won’t yield enough savings to offset the fees involved.<br>
                    
                    This also applies to anything booked with points that have a fixed value, like JetBlue TrueBlue,<br>
                     Southwest Rapid Rewards or Amtrak Guest Rewards points—no service is going to find a better deal <br>
                     than anyone can find on the airline website.<br>
